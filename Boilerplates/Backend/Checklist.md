> Progressive Web Application/Website Development
> 
> Looking to develop a website/progressive web application that allow people to meet virtually. It is specific to the substance use/mental health field. I would like to have a landing page that allows clients to schedule times with providers, allows providers to accept payment, and match people to providers in their area.

>Comprehensive Mobile App Solution similar to uber for clients and users
>
>Startup small business - will expand with time: need a developer to construct multi-platform mobile app (possibly web page, too), interact with Square for payment, will allow users to sign-up/create profiles, select a service. Will allow service clients to sign up, choose which services they can provide, their costs, and locations they serve (and submit any relevant certifications when required). Users will be matched to clients by location/service type (much like when ordering uber). Clients will keep appointment calendars and booking times and users will select from times and a series of rated clients (like booking through travelocity). Some communications, options for rescheduling, cancelling, etc. will be needed. For now, to avoid too much disclosure on the services provided, we'd like to possibly have the app have a UI for admin to login and upload photos/descriptions of services, vet/approve clients, etc. App will need to do some analytic tracking for clients (we can discuss in more detail). We will need to track client service hours for monthly invoicing (tracking for clients and admin) and invoicing. Will eventually add advertising and product sales options as services/territories expand. We need a cost-effective model/prototype that can justify going live for trial/proof of concept. We want to keep the work down to 50 - 60 hours for now, based on the hourly rate range (this is negotiable). Square was our initial thought for integrated ecommerce platform due to the ease of use but will consider others so long as it has sufficient capabilities for this project. We will pay directly for whatever cloud database / space is needed for this, Square account, domain registrations, etc, and coordinate username/passwords with developer. This is a project which, if the prototype functions, can take off very quickly and we can offer to expand contracts for developers in ongoing site and application maintenance. Would like to be on Android and IPhone to start.
