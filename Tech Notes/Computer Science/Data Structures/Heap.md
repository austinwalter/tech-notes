# Heap

## Implementation

### Types
- max-heap
- min-heap

### Operations
- insertion
	1. Add the element to the bottom level of the heap at the leftmost open space.
	2. Compare the added element with its parent; if they are in the correct order, stop.
	3. If not, swap the element with its parent and return to the previous step.
- deletion
- extract max/min
- increase/decrease key
- heapify (array to heap)
