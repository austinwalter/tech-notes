## Search Algorithms
- Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm
- Dijksta's Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm
- A* Search Algorithm
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
- Depth First and Breath First Searches

## Sorting Algorithms
Insertion
Selection
Bubble
Quick
Merge
Bead (for fun)
Heap
Timsort

## Graph Algorithms
roughly in increasing difficulty

1. Depth First Search & Breath First Search DFS/BFS
2. Flood Fill (Pretty much just a slight modification of DFS/BFS)
3. Topological sort
	Other than original uses, good so that you can perform shortest path on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in linear time.
4. Floyd Warshall
	(Floyd Warshall, Bellman Ford, and Dijkstra are all shortest path algorithms with different advantages/disadvantages)
5. Bellman Ford
	(btw, the optimization here is verrry useful. Turns the running time into something like O(# of edges) on the average case)
6. Dijkstra
7. Prim's Algorithm
	(not that necessary, since Kruskall's is better in almost every way)
8. Kruskall's Algorithm

## Geometry Algorithms

1. (Ray Casting Algorithm)
	Finding whether a point is inside a polygon
2. Sweep Line Technique
3. Convex Hull Algorithms

## Miscellaneous stuff
(Uh, both of these are actually really important)

1. Binary Search(Pretty much why everybody cares so much about sorting).
2. Dynamic Programming(Honestly, I feel like 1/3 of the problems I've seen are just some kind of DP)

## Other Stuff
I've heard is important but I've never actually coded because they are a massive pain to code (Should probably learn them sometime though).

1. Fast Fourier Transform (Probably really important in DSP?)
2. Maximal Flow Algorithms
