### Article Score
All review ratings will be described as a set. Set $R$ is all review values, and $n$ is the number of values in set $R$.

The mean can be described as:
$$
\overline{x}	 = \frac{10}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i}
$$
The ratio of positive values can be described as:
$$
r_{p} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n
\begin{cases}
	1 & \text{if } x_{i} > 6\\
	0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}  
$$
The variance:
$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n(x_{i}-\overline{x})^2  
$$

### Variance
The average of the squared differences from the Mean. 
It shows numerically how far the data points are from the mean. Neither the mean nor the median can describe this. 
$$
\sigma^{2}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_{i}-\mu)^2
$$
σ^2 - variance
n - number of scores
x - Individual score
μ - mean of scores




**Population** is a set of all elements or items that you’re interested in. Populations are often vast, which makes them inappropriate for collecting and analyzing data.

**Sample** is a subset of a population.
