# Microservices

Microservices, also known as the microservice architecture, is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are

- Independently deployable
- Loosely coupled
- Organized around business capabilities
- Owned by a small team
- Highly maintainable and testable

The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.
