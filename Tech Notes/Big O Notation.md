# Big O Notation

Big O notation is used to compare the efficiency of different algorithms, which is done by calculating how much memory is needed, and how much time it takes to complete.

**The two main measurements are:**
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity

**The three versions of these measurements:**
- Best Case
- Average Case
- Worst Case
